Software version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual documents the version 0.1.1 of the labeling tool (labelingtool
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

v0.1.1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the training and testing of vision algorithms it is necessary to use
 image sequences that where manually labeled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labeling task consists in tagging all objects in the image with a rectangle.
 Such operation needs to be done manually since the labeling is to be considered
 as the ground truth against which the results of the algorithms are compared.
 Any kind of error in the labeling process will have a negative impact in
 the performance of the algorithms and will compromise the reliability of
 the test results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual process is quite heavy and long, specially if the number of
 images is large, as normally is the case for video sequences.
 For that reason, this tools was developed aiming to alleviate the weight
 of this task.
 This was achieved in several ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way was to create an very light and fast interface that minimizes the
 number of operations necessary for each label.
 This was achieved by developing this tool in C++ (the OpenCV libraries
 where used).
 There was care into making the execution of all operations the fastest
 possible so that the user of the tool can immediately see the result of
 the commands executed, even if the commands are given in fast sequence.
 The manual tools that existed previously, developed in Matlab, where too
 slow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to alleviate the users work was to provide automatic mechanisms
 to create the labels without dispensing the user of the task of adjusting,
 at least, of verifying them.
 These automations try to place new label the closest possible of the intended
 final position for them.
 The user only needs to do small adjustments or to confirm the labels correctnes
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool is generic and can be applied to label any kind of object in any
 kind of images.
 Its limitation is that only rectangular labels are supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Instalation and compilation of the tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

Dependencies and supported OS's
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tool depends on the OpenCV libraries which need to be installed before
 build time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To build the tool is also necessary to have cmake installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tool was developed in linux, so it compiles and works well in this operating
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was also compiled and tested in Mac OS

Tool execution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Command line
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tool is executed inside the build folder (see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Compilar-a-ferramenta"

\end_inset

) using the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool [options] <video_file>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain help use
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool -h
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Video file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The video file can be in any format supported by OpenCV (examples: .mpg,
 .avi, .mkv, etc.).
 Name the file in the command line.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool lanchaArgos_clip1.avi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the file is in a different folder, then also include the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool videos/lanchaArgos_clip1.avi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Labeling file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the filename where the labels are saved is the same as the video
 file with its extension replace by .gt.txt.
 For example, the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool videos/lanchaArgos_clip1.avi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
creates the labeling file
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
videos/lanchaArgos_clip1.gt.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, a different filename can be specified using the -d option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool -d labels.gt.txt lanchaArgos_clip1.avi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labeling file format (labelingtool
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

v0.1) is a simple text file with one line per label.
 Each line has the following format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<frame number> <x> <y> <width> <height> <object id> <1(temporary)/0(final)>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file format is also documented in the tools's help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
./labeling_tool -h
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Autosave e backup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every 30 seconds a backup file with extension .autosave is saved with all
 labels and changes made so far.
 This file is deleted when the program exits normally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a backup file that is coppied from the original file before
 the program saves the new file.
 This backup file has the same filename as the original but with a tilde
 (~) added (example: labels.gt.txt~).

Mouse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to use the mouse, but that option is more useful for large
 movements, which are rare.
 It is preferable to keep the hands on the keyboard instead of waisting
 time moving the hand between the mouse and the keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mouse can be used to move or to modify a label by clicking and dragging.
 The point where the user clicks defines the operation.

\begin_layout Standard
Pointing the mouse over the straight line that extends the border (but outside

Moving the label border using the keyboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are independent keys to move each of the borders and in each direction
 (see Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mapa-do-teclado"

\end_inset

).
 The keys disposition is organized in a logic way in what concerns the border
 position and the movement direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, both keys that move the left border (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) are on the left side in relation to the other keys.
 In addition, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 key which is on the left side moves the border to the left and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 key which moves the border to the right is on the right side.
 Hopefully, this layout is intuitive enough so that the user can adjust
 the label without needing to look at the keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can even move the border faster, 10 pixels at a time, by simultaneously
 pressing the SHIFT key with the movement keys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Moving the whole label using the keyboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no specific keys to move the label as a whole.
 However, that effect is easily achieved using the same keys that move the
 borders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the user intents to move the label sideways to the left.
 This is the same as moving both left and right borders to the left by the
 same ammount.
 We can then use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

f
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 keys and press them rapidly one after the other and get the movement desired.
 Better yet, in most cases (depending on the keyboard hardware) we can even
 press them simultaneously since the keyboard will still send the two keystrokes
 one after the other (the ordering does not matter).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This technique even works if we keep pressing the SHIFT key, allowing for
 large movements of the whole label, 10 pixels each time.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label

Finalizing the labels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned before, the labels are created with type equal to temporary.
 This always happens either for manually or for automatically created labels.
 Is up for the user to verify all labels, adjust as necessary and then tag
 the labels as final.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For work optimization purposes, it was tried to minimize the number of keys
 that is necessary to press for each label.
 Towards that purpose, some operations, namely the ones that move the label
 or its borders, automatically set the label type to final.
 It is assumed that if the operator adjusted the label then it is already
 final or is in the process of becoming final.
 It is up to the user to make sure that all necessary adjustments are in
 fact made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If no adjustment whatsoever is necessary, the the label can be set to final
 by pressing SIFT +

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 only (without SHIFT) sets the label as temporary again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is yet the ENTER key which sets the current label as final and seeks
 to the next frame.
 This combination is useful when reviewing many labels (for example, after
 applying the automatic methods of subsection
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:automatismos"

\end_inset

).
 Probably in that case, many of the labels do not need adjustment and suffices
 to mark them as final and go to the next frame, and for all that the user
 only needs to press ENTER.

Automations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to alleviate the task of labeling is to use the available automations
 that, even though do not intend to replace the manual labeling, they can
 assist into making it easier.
 Four automatic methods are available, two of which operate image by image
 while the other two operate for a set of images in one step.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command copies the label of the previous frame to the current frame.
 The previous frame label needs to exist and be final, otherwise the command
 does nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the objects move very little from frame to frame, it is faster
 to copy the previous label and do small adjustments then to create a label
 from the start for every frame.

\begin_layout Standard
This command is identical to the previous one but, after copying the previous
 frame label, also searches, in the current frame and in the neighborhood
 of the copied label, for the image contained in the original label.
 The search is based on the minimization of the quadratic error between
 the two images.
 Finally, the position of the label is adjusted to the position where the
 error was smaller.
\end_layout

In most cases this approach produces very good labels only requiring occasional
 small adjustments.

\begin_layout Standard
By pressing

, the method goes backward in the video until it finds the previous final

 Then it does an linear interpolation between that label and the current
 frame label, either creating temporary labels for the frames in between
 or changing them if they already existed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method applies well to cases where the object moves along a line in

 Many of the movements found are linear or can be approximated by smaller
 linear sections.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this method the following steps are necessary:
\end_layout

create the temporary labels inside the set

 key
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By pressing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

u
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the method goes back in the video until it finds a final label, thus defining
 the frame where the set starts.
 Then it saves the images inside the labels at the extremes of the set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each frame within the set, the method searches in the neighborhood of
 the temporary label of this frame for the two images saved.
 The search is based on the minimization of the quadratic image error, similar
 to subsection
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:CÃ³pia-com-procura"

\end_inset

, but now two errors are obtained, one for each image.
 The errors are weighted according to the temporal distance between the
 current frame and the frames of the two saved images and then the lowest
 one is chosen.
 The current temporary label is then adjusted accordingly to the position
 found for the image chosen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weighting of the error based on time distance is justified by the assumption
 that the closer the images, the similar they should be.
 Using the two images at the extremes together with this weight allows for
 the method to work in larger sets with larger time intervals, even if the
 image of the object varies in those intervals (for example, the object
 can rotate, change size due to perspective, illumination can change, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method is well suited to be used with the previous method (subsection
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:InterpolaÃ§Ã£o-linear"

\end_inset

) since it compensates well for deviations of the object from the linear
 trajectory.
 Frequently the object's trajectory is not exactly linear.
 This can happen because the trajectory is in fact not linear (for example,
 if it is circular) but can also happen due to factors external to the object,
 such as camera vibrations or other camera movements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method was applied with great success to video sequences with up to

Label confirmation and verification

Note that none of this automatic methods eliminate need for the manual verificat
ion by the user (frame by frame) of the labels estimated automatically.
 In fact, the labeling tool marks those labels as temporary forcing the
 user to go by all of them to manually verify, adjust and set them as final.
 However, these methods obtain very good, and in many cases correct, labels
 for a large number of frames.
 By using them, the user only has to do occasional small adjustments and
 confirm the labels that are already correct.
