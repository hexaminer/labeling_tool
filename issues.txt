  -    - 0005 - Cmake fails when compiling with a new install of Ubuntu 12.4 with ros-hydro: Cmake cannot find FindOpenCV.cmake file.
                Installing package libopencv-core-devel provides /usr/share/OpenCV/OpenCVConfig-version.cmake and /usr/share/OpenCV/OpenCVConfig.cmake files. In this case cmake does not fail but subsequent make fails.
